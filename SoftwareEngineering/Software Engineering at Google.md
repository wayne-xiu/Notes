# Software Engineering at Google

[toc]

Three fundamental principles that software organizations should keep in mind when designing, architecting, and writing their code:

- *Time and Change*: How code will need to adapt over the length of its time
- *Scale and Growth*: How an organization will need to adapt as it evolves
- *Trade-offs and Costs*: How an organization makes decisions, based on the lessons of Time and Change and Scale and Growth
