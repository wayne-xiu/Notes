### Object-Oriented Solutions

Algorithm is a step-by-step recipe for performing a task within a finite period of time and operates on a collection of data

Express an understanding of the problem and the requirements of a solution in terms of objects within the problem domain. Think about the problem not how to solve it.

OOD: describe a solution in terms of software objects and collaborations of these object with one another. Objects collaborate when they send messages. Collaborations should be meaningful and minimal.

Design can emphasize interactions among objects (methods) or relationships among objects ("is a" and "has a" relationships)

Cohesion: Degree to which methods in a class operate on data within the class. High cohesion (good): methods only operate on class data; easy to reuse in other software projects and Robust

Coupling: Degree to which a class depends on other classes. Low coupling is good but coupling cannot be (and should not) be eliminated entirely. Class diagrams show dependencies among classes, hence coupling

Minimal and complete interfaces

Signature: programmer's interface for a method or function. Name, Arguments and Return type;
