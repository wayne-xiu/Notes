## Introduction to Complexity Measures

time and space

primitive operation

- Best case analysis - lower bound of execution time
- Worst case analysis - upper bound of execution time
- Average case analysis - compute the weighted average of the number of operations with the relative frequencies

time complexity

Asymptotic analysis and Big O

cares about large input sizes only

A function $f(n)$ is considered $O(g(n))$ if there exists some positive real constant c and an integer $n_0\geq 0$ such that the following inequality holds for all $n \geq n_0$: $f(n) \leq cg(n)$

$O(g(n))$ is a set of functions

When dealing with time and space complexities, we are generally interested in the tightest possible bound when it comes to the asymptotic notation.

![commonFunctions](Media/commonFunctions.png)

The above table lists some commonly encountered functions in ascending order of rate of growth. Any function can be given as Big O of any other function that appears later in this table.

Other common Asymptotic notations

- Big 'Omega' - $\Omega$: a function $f(n)$ is in $\Omega(g(n))$ if $f(n)$ will grow at least as fast as $g(n)$

> It is a common misconception that Big O characterizes worst case running time while Big Omega characterizes best case running time of an algorithm. There is no one-to-one relationship between any of these cases and the asymptotic notations.

if $f(n) \in O(g(n))$ then $g(n) \in \Omega(f(n))$

- Big 'Theta' - $\Theta$: if $f(n)$ is in $O(g(n))$ and $f(n)$ is also in $\Omega(g(n))$ then it is in $\Omega(n)$; If $f(n)$ is $\Theta(g(n))$, then the two functions grow at the same rate, within constant factors. So Big Theta is an "asymptotically tight bound.'
- Little 'o': the little o notation is for strictly less
- Little 'omega': 

Big 'O' is preferred over other notations

In algorithm analysis, we tend to focus on the worst case time and space complexity. It tends to be more useful to know that the *worst case* running time of a particular algorithm will grow **at most** as fast as a constant multiple of a certain function than to know that it will grow **at least** as fast as some other function. In other words, Big Omega is often not very useful for use with worst case running time.

Big Theta would be nice to have with a tight bound. Big O is a subset of Big Theta.

The little o and little omega notations require a strict level of inequality (< or >) and the ability to show that there is a valid $n_0$ for any valid choice of $c$. This is not always easy to do.

General tips for calculating complexity

1. Every time a list or arrays gets iterated over $c*length$ times, it is most likely in $O(n)$ time
2. When you see a problem where the number of elements in the problem space gets halved each time, it will most probably be in $O(logn)$ runtime
3. Whenever you have a singly nested loop, the problem is most likely in quadratic time

List of common complexities

- simple for-loop: $O(n)$
- for-loop with increments: $O(n)$
- simple nested for-loop: $O(nm)$
- nested for-loop with dependent variables: $O(n^2)$
- nested for-loop with index modification: $O(n)$ - TODO
- loops with log(n) time complexity: $O(log_k(n))$

## Introduction to Arrays

same data element type; contiguous in memory; static (compile time, on the stack) or dynamic (run time, on the heap) array no bounds checking

dynamic arrays in memory are stored using a reference pointer which points to the first element of the array. For example, if we create int* arr = new int[3], then the variable will point to the start of the array. Memory assigned to arr will be on the stack. The memory created by new keyword will be on heap.

```c++
// Write an ArrayList that could resize and insert element
class ArrayList {
    int* arr;
    int num_elements;
    int capacity;
public:
    ArrayList(int size) {
        arr = new int[size];
        num_elements = 0;
        capacity = size;
    }
    void insert(int val) {
        if (num_elements >= capacity)
            resize();
        arr[num_elements] = val;
        num_elements++;
    }
    void resize() {
        int* temp = new int[capacity*2];
        capacity *= 2;
        for (int i = 0; i < num_elements; ++i)
            temp[i] = arr[i];
        delete[] arr;
        arr = temp;
    }
    int length() {
        return num_elements;
    }
    int getAt(int index) {
        return arr[index];
    }
    void print() {
        for (int i = 0; i < num_elements; ++i)
            cout << arr[i] << " ";
        cout << endl;
    }
};
```



Multidimensional arrays

2D array as an array of the one-dimensional array

```c++
data_type arr[row][col];
// dynamic
datatype** arr = new datatype* [row];
for (int i = 0; i < row; ++i)
    arr[i] = new datatype[col];

// free memory
for (int i = 0; i < row; ++i)
    delete[] arr[i];
delete[] arr;
```



## Introduction to Linked Lists

Linked-list is a data structure formed by nodes that are linked together like a chain. Each node holds data, along with a pointer to the next node in the list.

### Singly Linked List (SLL)

```c++
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* nextElement;
    Node() {
        nextElement = nullptr;
    }
};

class LinkedList {
public:
    LinkedList() {
        head = nullptr;
    }
    bool isEmpty() const {
        return (head == nullptr) ? true : false;
    }
    bool printList() const {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "List is empty!" << endl;
            return false;
        }
        Node* temp = head;
        cout << "List: ";
        while (temp != nullptr) {
            cout << temp->data << "->";
            temp = temp->nextElement;
        }
        cout << "null" << endl;
        return true;
    }
    // Insertion at head, tail and index position
    void insertAtHead(int value) {
        Node* newNode = new Node();
        newNode->data = value;
        newNode->nextElement = head;
        head = newNode;
        //cout << value << " inserted at head!  ";
    }
    void insertAtTail(int value) {
        Node* newNode = new Node();
        newNode->data = value;
        newNode->nextElement = nullptr;
        if (isEmpty())
            head = newNode;
        else {
            Node* last = head;
            while (last->nextElement != nullptr)
                last = last->nextElement;
            last->nextElement = newNode;
        }
        //cout << value << " inserted at tail!  ";
    }
    void insertAtIndex(int value, int index) {
        if (index == 0)
            insertAtHead(value);
        else {
            Node* current = head;
            for (int i = 1; i < index; ++i) {
                if (current->nextElement != nullptr) {
                    current = current->nextElement;
                } else {
                    cout << "Can't insert at " << index << endl;
                    return;
                }
            }
            Node* newNode = new Node();
            newNode->data = value;
            newNode->nextElement = current->nextElement;
            current->nextElement = newNode;
            //cout << value << " insert at position " << index << "! ";
        }
    }
    
    // Search
    bool search(int value) const {
        Node* temp = head;
        while (temp != nullptr) {
            if (temp->data == value)
                return true;
            temp = temp->nextElement;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    // Deletion at head, tail and by value
    bool deleteAtHead() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "List is empty" << endl;
            return false;
        }
        Node* currentNode = head;
        head = head->nextElement;

        delete currentNode;
        return true;
    }
    bool deleteAtTail() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "List is empty" << endl;
            return false;
        }
        if (head->nextElement == nullptr)
            return deleteAtHead();
        Node* currentNode = head;
        Node* prevNode = nullptr;
        while (currentNode->nextElement != nullptr) {
            prevNode = currentNode;
            currentNode = currentNode->nextElement;
        }
        prevNode->nextElement = nullptr;
        delete currentNode;
        return true;
    }
    bool deleteByValue(int value) {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "List is empty" << endl;
            return false;
        }
        if (head->data == value)
            return deleteAtHead();
        Node* currentNode = head;
        while (currentNode != nullptr && currentNode->nextElement != nullptr) {
            if (currentNode->nextElement->data == value) {
                Node* temp = currentNode->nextElement;
                currentNode->nextElement = temp->nextElement;
                delete temp;
                return true;
            }
            currentNode = currentNode->nextElement;
        }
        return false;
    }
private:
    Node* head;
};
```

For any operations on the list, we need to traverse it from the head. The main difference between arrays and linked lists is memory allocation. In linked lists, there is no concept of indexing.

> Note: even when a linked list is empty, the head node must always exist

The main difference between array and linked list is memory allocation.

Insertion:

- at head
- at tail
- at the N-th index

Search

Deletion at the head, at the tail and by value

### Doubly Linked List (DLL)

For SLL, we have to keep track of previous elements;

For DLL, in insertion and deletion, we need to change two pointers instead of one.

```c++
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* nextElement;
    Node* previousElement;
    Node() {
        nextElement = nullptr;
        previousElement = nullptr;
    }
};

class DoublyLinkedList {
public:
    DoublyLinkedList() {
        head = nullptr;
    }
    bool isEmpty() {
        return head == nullptr;
    }
    Node* getHead() {
        return head;
    }
    bool printList() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "List is empty" << endl;
            return false;
        }
        Node* temp = head;
        cout << "List: ";
        while (temp != nullptr) {
            cout << temp->data << "<->";
            temp = temp->nextElement;
        }
        cout << "null" << endl;
        return true;
    }

    // Insertion
    bool insertAtHead(int value) {
        Node* newNode = new Node();
        newNode->data = value;
        newNode->previousElement = nullptr;
        newNode->nextElement = head;
        if (head != nullptr)
            head->previousElement = newNode;
        head = newNode;
        cout << value << " inserted at head!  ";
        return true;
    }

    // Deletion
    bool deleteAtHead() {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "List is empty" << endl;
            return false;
        }
        head = head->nextElement;
        head->previousElement = nullptr;
        return true;
    }
    bool deleteByValue(int value) {
        if (isEmpty()) {
            cout << "List is empty" << endl;
            return false;
        }
        if (head->data == value)
            return deleteAtHead();
        Node* currentNode = head;
        while (currentNode != nullptr) {
            if (currentNode->data == value) {
                currentNode->previousElement->nextElement = currentNode->nextElement;
                if (currentNode->nextElement != nullptr)
                    currentNode->nextElement->previousElement = currentNode->previousElement;
                cout << value << " deleted!" << endl;
                return true;
            }
            currentNode = currentNode->nextElement;
        }
        return false;
    }
private:
    Node* head;
};
```



DLL compared with SLL:

- DLL can be traversed in both directions
- Nodes in DLL require extra memory to store the previousNode pointer
- Deletion in DLL is more efficient as we do not need to keep track of the previous node

Keep a Tail pointer in LLs (especially DLL) will improve the functionality performance

Reverse a  DLL by iterative pointer manipulation

```c++
void reverse() {
    Node* temp = nullptr;
    Node* current = head;
    while (current != nullptr) {
        temp = current->previousElement;
        current->previousElement = current->nextElement;
        current->nextElement = temp;
        current = current->previousElement;
    }
    if (temp != nullptr)
        head = temp->previousElement;
}
```

Detect loops in a linked list

```c++
bool detectLoop() {
    Node* slow = head;
    Node* fast = head;
    while (slow && fast && fast->nextElement) {
        slow = slow->nextElement;
        fast = fast->nextElement->nextElement;
        if (slow == fast)  // if meets
            return true;
    }
    return false;
}
// helper for testing
void insertLoop() {
    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp->nextElement)
        temp = temp->nextElement;
    temp->nextElement = head;
}
```

Find middle value of a linked list

```c++
    int findMid() {
        if (isEmpty())
            return 0;
//        int length = this->length();
//        int mid = (length % 2) ? (length/2+1) : length/2;
//        Node* temp = head;
//        for (int i = 1; i < mid; ++i)
//            temp = temp->nextElement;
//        return temp->data;
        Node* current = head;
        if (current->nextElement == nullptr)
            return current->data;
        Node* middle = current;
        current = current->nextElement->nextElement;
        while (current != nullptr) {
            middle = middle->nextElement;
            current = current->nextElement;
            if (current != nullptr)
                current = current->nextElement;
        }
        if (middle != nullptr)
            return middle->data;
        return 0;
    }

```

Remove duplicates from a linked list

```c++
void removeDuplicates() {
    Node* start = head;
    Node* startNext, *dup;
    while (start != nullptr && start->nextElement != nullptr) {
        startNext = start;
        while (startNext->nextElement != nullptr) {
            if (start->data == startNext->nextElement->data) {
                dup = startNext->nextElement;  // sequence matters
                startNext->nextElement = startNext->nextElement->nextElement;
                delete(dup);
            }
            else
                startNext = startNext->nextElement;
        }
        start = start->nextElement;
    }
}
```

$O(n^2)$
