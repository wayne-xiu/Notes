## So You want to be a wizard

- asking good (dumb) questions
  - easy for the person to answer
  - get you the information you are looking for
  - do some research and find the best person to ask
  - ask yes/no questions
- reading the source code
  - grep for the error message
  - step through with a debugger
  - add tests
  - add print statements
  - introduce bugs
  - experiment!
  - don't always trust the comments
- debugging
  - love your bugs
  - the bug is happening for a logical reason. It's never magic, even when it makes no sense
  - know your debugging toolkit
- designing
  - you can't predict how requirements will change
  - "good enough" is often really awesome
  - making a proof of concept can really help
- building expertise
  - building expertise took time (years)
  - picking something to focus on and
  - *actively* working on getting better at it
  - never late, start today
  - methods
    - learn fundamental concepts
    - do experiments
    - read books
    - do hard projects
    - dig in and be patient
- strategies for learning
  - learning at work
    - read source code
    - ask questions
    - watch talks
    - read docs/blog posts
    - do experiments
    - don't: advocate for using something at work just because you want to learn it
  - learning on your own
    - go to a conference
    - implement something that seems hard
    - pick a concept and spend 3 hours on it
    - try a new tool
    - read a paper
    - do some experiments
    - teach/blog it
      - revisiting basic questions is important
      - it forces me to realize when I don't actually understand something well yet
