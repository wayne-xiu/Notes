- asking good (dumb) questions
  - easy for the person to answer
  - get you the information you are looking for
  - do some research and find the best person to ask
  - ask yes/no questions
- reading the source code
  - grep for the error message
  - step through with a debugger
  - add tests
  - add print statements
  - introduce bugs
  - experiment!
  - don't always trust the comments
- debugging
  - love your bugs
  - the bug is happening for a logical reason. It's never magic, even when it makes no sense
  - know your debugging toolkit
- designing
  - 
- building expertise
- strategies for learning
  - learning at work
    - read source code
    - ask questions
    - watch talks
    - read docs/blog posts
    - do experiments
    - don't: advocate for using something at work just because you want to learn it
  - learning on your own
    - go to a conference
    - implement something that seems hard
    - pick a concept and spend 3 hours on it
    - try a new tool
    - read a paper
    - do some experiments
    - teach/blog it
      - revisiting basic questions is important
      - it forces me to realize when I don't actually understand something well yet
