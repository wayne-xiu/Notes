### The Requirements for Autonomy

driving taxonomy (classification), perception and driving decisions

#### 1. Taxonomy of Driving Automation

perceiving, planning, controlling

SAE [J3016](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3016_202104/) classification

- Level 0: no automation
- Level 1: Driving assistance (e.g. Adaptive cruise control, Lane keeping assistance), either Longitudinal control or Lateral control, but not both
- Level 2: Partial Driving automation - (e.g. GM super cruise) both Longitudinal and Lateral control
- Level 3: Conditional driving automation - includes automated object and event detection and response
- Level 4: High Driving Automation - handles emergencies autonomously; Longitudinal control, Lateral control, OEDR, Fallback (e.g. only Waymo)
- Level 5: Full Driving automation - Unlimited ODD

#### 2. Requirements for Perception



#### 3. Driving decisions and Actions
