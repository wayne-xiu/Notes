# Design Patterns in C++

[toc]

## Creational

### Preliminaries

Design patterns are common architectural approaches; GoF

Pattern

- motivation
- classic implementation
- pattern variations
- library implementations
- pattern interactions
- important considerations (e.g. testability)

#### SOLID Design Principles

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  - a class should only have a single responsibility
- Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
  - Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
  - Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering program correctness
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  - Many client-specific interfaces better than one general-purpose interface
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
  - Dependencies should be abstract rather than concrete
