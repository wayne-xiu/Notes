## Computer Vision with OpenCV

```python
conda create -n cv  --clone base
conda activate cv
# update pip
pip install --upgrade pip
# install opencv-python
pip install opencv-python
# install latest tensorflow
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```

### Image formation and digital representation

what computer sees: a stream of raw numbers from a camera sensor

Images

- 2-Dimensional representation of the visible light spectrum

Digital image

- BGR in OpenCV
- Each pixel is a combination of the brightness of blue, green and red; ranging from 0 to 255 (255 being the brightest)
- color image has 3 channels
- grayscale image only needs 2-Dimensions to be represented

Human brains are super good at vision
